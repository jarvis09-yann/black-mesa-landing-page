## NOTE:

DOD means Department Of Defense more info on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Department_of_Defense).

English not being my first language there may be some english mistakes. If you find any, feel free to make a pull request.

Ideas of future improvements: adding a form and a backend where users could send (fake) applications to work at Black Mesa (probably will be when i'll learn backend dev.)

Parts of the text have been AI generated (i guess it's still better than just Lorem Ipsum)

Thank you for checking out my silly website.
